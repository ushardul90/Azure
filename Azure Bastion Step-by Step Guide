Azure Bastion Step-by Step Guide

The Azure Bastion service is a new fully platform-managed PaaS service that you provision inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly in the Azure portal over SSL.
The good thing about this, is that When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines do not need a public IP address.

How Azure Bastion Works?
Azure bastion receives connections from the internet using SSL and connects you back to your VMs using RDP and SSH.
